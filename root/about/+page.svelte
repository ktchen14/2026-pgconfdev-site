<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  The PostgreSQL Development Conference, aka “<abbr>PGConf.dev</abbr>”, is where
  users, developers, and community organizers come together to focus on
  <a href={postgresql} target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> development and community growth.
</p>

<p>
  PGConf.dev is the successor to <a href={pgcon} target="_blank">PGCon</a>, and
  focuses on creating a fun and constructive environment for PostgreSQL
  contributors to meet, collaborate, and learn from each other.
</p>

<p>
  PGConf.dev is made possible by the generous support of our sponsors, the
  amazing content from our speakers, the volunteers who help to organize and run
  the event, and the participation of the PostgreSQL contributor community.
